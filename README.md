        Inspired by the <a href=https://itch.io/jam/stop-waiting-for-godot>STOP WAITING FOR GODOT</a> jam, the idea was sparked to learn Godot. 
        Unfortunately, time was short and participation in the jam was not possible. 
        So a rough deadline was set: two and a half to three days (that's how much time would have been realistically available for the jam) to watch tutorials, read documentation and code. 
        The result was a small game, where a flat cylinder tries to save rectangular cuboids from cubes with help of its tractor beam.
    </p>
        Fast forward one month: the project is tackled again - with the aim of upgrading it visually and acoustically and improving the gameplay. 
        Whenever time allows, the game is tinkered with to further learn. 
        The latest build, as well as the original prototype, can be found on <a href=https://elstudio314.itch.io/ufo>itch.io</a>.

        I hope you have fun with it! <br>
